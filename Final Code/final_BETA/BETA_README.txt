collision_detection probably needs to be renamed rout_planner (and then finished)

python_prototype.py is a prototype game class that will be transferred to .ino when complete (maybe)

script is the file that runs the game and communicates with Penny

support.py is a list of support functions useful in the interpreter for dynamic debugging in the shell
